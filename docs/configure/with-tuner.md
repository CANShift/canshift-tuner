# Configure with the Tuner

The Tuner is a single-page web app that talks to the dash over Web Serial. You move widgets, bind signals, pick an ECU profile — then click **Burn** and the dash reloads the new config in place. No re-flash, no reboot.

The Tuner lives at [tuner.canshift.app](https://tuner.canshift.app) — open the URL, plug the dash in, you're in.

## Connecting

1. Plug the dash in over USB-C.
2. Open [tuner.canshift.app](https://tuner.canshift.app) in a Chromium-based browser.
3. Click **Connect device** in the top-right and pick the serial port.

The header switches from a red _Disconnected_ dot to a green _Connected_ one, with the device's `vendor:product` next to it. The firmware version slot fills in once the handshake completes (~50 ms).

> [!TIP]
> **Simulation mode**
>
> No dash on hand? The Tuner runs in simulation when no device is connected — pages and widgets are
> interactive, the signal store fakes values. Useful for laying out a dashboard the night before
> fitting.

## Edit the dashboard

The **Dashboard** route is the visual editor. Page thumbnails on the left (up to `CONFIG_MAX_PAGES = 5`), the canvas in the middle, the inspector on the right. Click a widget to bind it to a signal, drop a new widget from the palette to add it, drag to reorder.

Changes are local until you burn. The canvas previews exactly what the dash will render — same fonts, same tokens, same units.

## Pick an ECU profile

Open the **ECU** route. CANShift ships presets for the common aftermarket and stock setups:

- **Aftermarket**: Haltech, Ecumaster EmuBlack, Adaptronic, AEM, Link, MaxxECU, MoTeC, Flagtronics.
- **OEM-style**: stock OBD-II PIDs (works with most road cars supporting the standard).

Pick a preset, preview the signals it would import, click _Apply_. The signal map writes to `signals.json` on the dash.

Custom map? Drop a **CAN XML** export onto the page. The parser lives in `@tmbk/canshift-core/parseCanXml` and validates against the same schema the firmware enforces at boot.

## Style with themes

The **Themes** route swaps the dash's colour palette — day vs night, accent colours, gauge backgrounds. The Tuner reads the active mode from the device on connect and exposes three actions: toggle, force _Day_, force _Night_. The commands hit the dash as `CMD_TOGGLE_DAY_NIGHT` / `CMD_SET_DAY_NIGHT` over USB.

## Burn = write the config

Click **Burn** (top-right) and the Tuner ships the full JSON envelope to the dash. The dash:

1. Shows the "Saving config…" overlay.
2. Writes the new file to SPIFFS atomically (the previous one is renamed `.bak`).
3. Reloads the config in memory.
4. Rebuilds the pages on the next frame.

End-to-end takes ~150–250 ms. The overlay vanishes when the burn completes; the new layout appears on the next page swipe (or immediately if you're on the page that changed).

If the overlay flips red, see [Burn errors](../configure/burn-errors.md).

> [!WARNING]
> **Don't burn during a CAN scan**
>
> The dash's USB RX buffer doubles as the PUT_CONFIG receive buffer. A live CAN scan keeps that
> buffer busy, and a burn that lands in the middle of a scan can time out. Stop the scan in the
> **CAN bus** route first, then burn.

## Schema vs firmware version

The firmware validates `dashboard.json` against the schema it was compiled with. If you re-flash a newer firmware but SPIFFS still holds an older config, the dash boots into the built-in default and the ErrorBar shows `SCHEMA_MISMATCH`.

The fix is always the same: re-burn from the Tuner. The Tuner always reads the current schema from `canshift-core`, so a fresh burn matches the running firmware by construction.
