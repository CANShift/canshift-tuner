# CANShift dash — design system

The binding specification for the firmware UI (LVGL, CrowPanel 2.8″, 320 × 240, landscape).
Visual references: `CANShift Dash Pages.dc.html` (the six pages rendered at 2×), `DASH_PAGES.json` (the
same six pages as data) and `CANShift States and Alerts.dc.html` (the severity levels, the system states
and the full control-state matrix). Where the firmware and this document disagree, the firmware is wrong.

Read the whole document before writing code. Then: audit, list deviations, fix in the order at the end.

---

## 0. The two rules everything else follows from

1. **A widget is a rule, a kicker and a value.** Not a card. There is no box, no fill, no border and no
   background behind a value anywhere on the dash. The horizontal rule above the widget is what separates
   it from its neighbour. The single exception is the button widget (§6), which is a 2 px outlined box.
2. **Nothing is centred, nothing is rounded, nothing eases.** Everything is flush left against its
   column. Radius is 0. The only motion is the six behaviours listed in §9.

If you are about to draw a rounded rectangle with a grey fill behind a number, stop — that is the drift
this document exists to correct.

## 1. Scale

The design references are authored at **2×**: a 640 × 480 box standing for the 320 × 240 panel.

- **Implement the device column.** Halve any measurement taken off a reference screenshot.
- Type is the exception: fonts are generated at the device sizes in §3, and no label goes below 10 px
  real. Where halving would give less than 10, use 10.

## 2. Colour

Two themes. Danger and engaged are the same in both — they are safety colours, not theme colours.

| Role                                               | Token          | NIGHT (default) | DAY       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Ground                                             | `CS_BG`        | `#121212`       | `#DDDDDD` |
| Ink — values, primary rules, button outlines       | `CS_INK`       | `#FFFFFF`       | `#000000` |
| Dim — kickers, units, status row                   | `CS_DIM`       | `#BABAB8`       | `#5A5A5A` |
| Track — bar grounds, unlit shift cells, 1 px rules | `CS_TRACK`     | `#222222`       | `#C4C4C4` |
| Warning                                            | `CS_WARN`      | `#FF8800`       | `#FF8800` |
| Danger                                             | `CS_DANGER`    | `#FF4444`       | `#FF4444` |
| Engaged                                            | `CS_ENGAGED`   | `#FF4747`       | `#FF4747` |
| Locked — unavailable control outline               | `CS_LOCK_LINE` | `#333333`       | `#B4B4B4` |
| Locked — unavailable control text                  | `CS_LOCK_INK`  | `#6B6B6B`       | `#8A8A8A` |

Nine tokens, and there is no tenth. No gradient, no shadow, no tint, no opacity below 100 % except the
75 % white used for a kicker on an engaged button and the pulse in §9.

**Four severity levels**, and the level is always carried by the rule and the ground — never by an icon or
a badge:

| Level       | Token       | Reads as                                                                                                                |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Information | none        | a normal widget. A transient state needing no action looks like a healthy value.                                        |
| Warning     | `CS_WARN`   | one reading out of range: rule, kicker and value amber, unit stays Dim, page untouched, nothing blinks.                 |
| Critical    | `CS_DANGER` | the engine is at risk: full pulsing takeover (§10). Physical danger only.                                               |
| Failure     | `CS_DANGER` | the system cannot continue: danger rule on the normal ground, the reason in mono, one stated way out. Never a takeover. |

**Warning vs danger vs engaged.** `#FF8800` means _out of range, keep driving and watch it_ — and it is
also the DO NOT UNPLUG line during a firmware update. `#FF4444` means _danger or failure_. `#FF4747`
means _this function is on_ and only ever fills a button. Never swapped, never two on one widget.

## 3. Type

Two LVGL bitmap fonts, generated with `lv_font_conv`. Generate exactly the sizes used — no scaling at
runtime.

- **Archivo 800** — kickers and button state words only.
- **JetBrains Mono** — every value, every unit, the status row. **Tabular numerals are mandatory**: a
  value must not change width as its digits change.

| Class       | Device | Canvas (2×) | Tracking | Line-height | Used for                                          |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `hero`      | 48     | 96          | -0.045em | 0.92        | Street speed/gear, Timing lap/delta               |
| `heroTrack` | 44     | 88          | -0.045em | 0.92        | Track rpm/gear, Tuning boost, Controls launch rpm |
| `primary`   | 32     | 64          | -0.045em | 0.92        | the main readings of Engine, Tuning, Track        |
| `mid`       | 22     | 44          | -0.03em  | 0.92        | Street rpm, Timing best/last/laps                 |
| `secondary` | 17     | 34          | -0.03em  | 0.92        | every small reading                               |
| `button`    | 14     | 28          | 0        | 1           | button state word                                 |
| `kicker`    | 10     | 10          | 0.18em   | —           | every widget label, UPPERCASE, in Dim             |
| `unit`      | 10     | 16          | —        | —           | in Dim, inline after the value                    |
| `statusRow` | 10     | 12          | 0.1em    | —           | the three status fields, in Dim                   |

Units are lowercase as the car states them (`km/h`, `rpm`, `bar`, `°C`, `%`, `V`, `km`, `λ`, `s`), set in
Dim, on the same baseline, one space after the value. Kickers are uppercase. No unit on a gear, a lap
time, a knock count or a button.

## 4. Frame and grid

|                               | Device    | Canvas    |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Panel                         | 320 × 240 | 640 × 480 |
| Outer padding, all four sides | 8         | 16        |
| Column count                  | 12        | 12        |
| Column gap                    | 6         | 12        |
| Row gap                       | 6         | 12        |
| Snap step used by the Tuner   | 8         | 8         |

Content stacks: shift light (only where the page declares one) → status row → widget grid. The grid is
`align-content: start` — widgets keep their natural height and the page ends where the content ends. The
empty ground at the bottom of a short page is correct; do not stretch widgets to fill it.

Spans are out of 12 and are given per page in `DASH_PAGES.json`. Reproduce them exactly — they are what
the Tuner writes into the config.

## 5. Value widget

```
┌──────────────────────────  rule: 2px INK (primary) | 1px TRACK (secondary) | 2px DANGER
  KICKER                     Archivo 800, 10px, 0.18em, UPPERCASE, DIM
  184203 km                  Mono, class size, INK; unit 10px DIM
  ▓▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░░░░             optional bar, only when the signal is a percentage of a range
```

Device metrics:

|                      | Primary (`hero`/`heroTrack`/`primary`) | Secondary (`mid`/`secondary`) |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Rule                 | 2 px `CS_INK`                          | 1 px `CS_TRACK`               |
| Padding top / bottom | 4 / 3                                  | 3 / 2                         |
| Padding right        | 8                                      | 8                             |
| Padding left         | **0**                                  | **0**                         |
| Kicker → value gap   | 2                                      | 1                             |

- **Left padding is zero.** The kicker and the value sit flush on the column edge; only the right side is
  inset so two widgets do not touch.
- **Warning variant**: rule, kicker and value all in `CS_WARN`; the unit stays Dim. Nothing else changes.
- **Danger variant**: same, in `CS_DANGER`. Neither variant adds a fill, an icon, a box or a blink.
- **Bar gauge** (only where `DASH_PAGES.json` gives a `bar`): 2 px tall device, ground `CS_TRACK`, fill
  `CS_INK` (or `CS_DANGER` in a danger widget), 4 px above it, right margin matching the widget, square
  ends, no border, no label.

## 6. Button widget

The only boxed widget. Used on Controls and for the Timing timer.

|            | Device                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Border     | 2 px                                                                |
| Min height | 48                                                                  |
| Padding    | 6 vertical / 7 horizontal                                           |
| Content    | kicker above, state word below, both flush left, vertically centred |

Four states, and every control reads the same four ways so the driver never learns a second vocabulary:

- **Off**: border `CS_INK`, ground = the page ground, kicker Dim, state word Ink.
- **Armed**: identical to off, pulsing per §9. The condition is met but the function has not fired
  (`LAUNCH · 4200 rpm — ARMED`, `CRUISE · SET 110 — ARMED`).
- **Active**: border **and** ground `CS_ENGAGED`, kicker white at 75 %, state word white. **Steady** — an
  active control never pulses. A control that is intervening says so in its kicker
  (`TRACTION · CUTTING`), it does not move.
- **Unavailable**: border `CS_LOCK_LINE`, text `CS_LOCK_INK`, and **the kicker states why** — never a bare
  grey-out: `ANTI-LAG` / `EGT HIGH`, `LAUNCH` / `MOVING`, `TRACTION` / `NO WHEEL SPEED`,
  `PIT LIMIT` / `GEAR 4`, `CRUISE` / `BRAKE CUT`. State word `LOCKED`, `N/A` or `CANCELLED`.

**A button kicker stacks: name on the first line, qualifier on the second** — never joined with `·`.
The separator is for the splash and the status row, which have a full screen width to spend; a button does
not. A 4-column button is 79 px of usable width and the kicker face measures ~8 px per character, so 9
characters is the whole budget — `PIT LIMIT` alone spends it. Any joined form therefore wraps mid-phrase
(`ANTI-LAG · EGT` / `HIGH`), which is why the qualifier owns its own line and the button is sized for two.

**Armed is declared per control, not carried by all four.** It exists only where the car really holds that
state — launch armed at a target rpm, cruise set but not holding, traction set to a level but not cutting.
Anti-lag and pit limit are **binary**: they go straight from off to active, because there is no physical
in-between for them and a pulse there would only be reporting bus latency, which is not the driver's
problem. A control with no armed state that is tapped and never confirmed on the bus returns to off after
15 s — silently, with no error word, because the dash cannot tell a lost frame from a slow ECU.

| Control                      | Armed                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Launch, cruise, traction     | yes — a real state of the car |
| Anti-lag, pit limit, ECU map | no — binary, off ⇄ active     |

**Two kinds of button**, legible from the state word alone:

- **Toggle** — anti-lag, launch, pit limit, cruise. One tap engages, the next disengages; the state word
  is a word (`ON`/`OFF`, `ARMED`).
- **Stepper** — traction control and the ECU map. **Each tap raises the level by one** (1, 2, 3 … 6), and
  the tap past the top wraps back to `OFF`, so the whole range is reachable with one finger and no second
  button. A 600 ms long press returns to level 1. The segment row under the state word is the only
  readout of the current level.

Extra rules:

- Real touch target never below 48 × 50 px device — widen the span rather than shrink the box.
- No unit, no icon, no state dot. A traction-control glyph is an OEM convention and unreadable at
  320 px; the word plus the state carries it, and the word is what the driver would say out loud.
- A level control (traction 1–6) shows a row of segment cells under the state word: 2 px device high,
  lit in Ink (white at 30 % over an engaged fill), unlit in `CS_TRACK`.

**A value class sets a floor on its box.** A widget renders a top rule, a kicker line and the value line,
so the box must hold all three or the value spills past the bottom edge and collides with the row below.
Measured minimums, device pixels: **hero 48 → 93**, **heroTrack 44 → 71**, **primary 32 → 60**,
**mid 22 → 40**, **secondary 17 → 40**. Check the floor before changing a `rowSpan` or a `big`.

Track is the one page that cannot hold three tiers at spec sizes: the shift strip (13 px) and the alert
line band (16 px) leave it 195 px, and `row + rowSpan <= 12` costs it another track because the strip
takes raw row 0. Its SPEED and OIL PRESS therefore render at **mid**, not primary — a deliberate
deviation, and the one to revisit first if the alert band ever stops being reserved on every page.

## 7. Shift light

Only on a page that declares it (Track). One row across the full content width:

- 12 equal cells, height 7 px device, gaps 2 px device, square, no border.
- Cells 1–7 `CS_INK`, cells 8–9 `CS_DANGER`, cells 10–12 `CS_TRACK` when unlit.
- Fills left to right with rpm. At the limiter the whole row blinks (§9).

## 7b. Cut band

A protection cut (boost, fuel, ignition, knock retard, rev limit, overheat, limp) shows a persistent
full-width band directly under the shift light for as long as the cut lasts: a 2 px rule in the severity
colour, the cut name in Archivo 800 (0.16em, uppercase), the measured value against its limit in mono, and
the elapsed time right-aligned. One line, flush left, 26 px device tall.

Amber CS_WARN when the cut holds a target (overboost, rev limit, traction, pit limit), detail dim; danger
CS_DANGER when it protects the engine (oil pressure, overheat, limp), detail in Ink. The causing value
takes the same colour on its own widget. Cut names come from the ECU profile, never invented at runtime.

Minimum on-screen time 1.5 s so a 60 ms cut is readable; a latched cut reads LATCHED instead of a timer;
concurrent cuts stack most-severe-first, three maximum. A cut is not driver-requested, so it never takes
the screen and never pulses — see §F of the states plank.

## 8. Status row

One line, mono, Dim, 0.1em tracking, exactly three fields — left, centre, right:

| Page     | Left         | Centre   | Right             |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------------- |
| Street   | `CAN 842 Hz` | `MAP 1`  | `TRIP 128 km`     |
| Track    | `CAN 842 Hz` | `MAP 1`  | `LAP 4 — 1:38.42` |
| Engine   | `CAN 842 Hz` | `MAP 1`  | `MAX OIL 128`     |
| Tuning   | `CAN 842 Hz` | `MAP 2`  | `PEAK 1.61`       |
| Timing   | `CAN 842 Hz` | `LAP 4`  | `BEST 1:36.08`    |
| Controls | `CAN 842 Hz` | `ALS ON` | `ARMED`           |

Never a fourth field, never an icon, never a coloured status. The left field is always the bus rate.

## 9. Motion — the complete list

Nothing else on the dash moves.

| Behaviour                           | Rule                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Value update                        | **snap**. Never tween a numeral.                                                                                                    |
| Bar gauge / arc                     | catch up in 120 ms **linear**                                                                                                       |
| Rev limit                           | hard on/off blink at 6 Hz, no easing                                                                                                |
| **Armed** state                     | 1 s ease-in-out pulse, 100 % → 35 % opacity. The pulse belongs to armed and to armed only — active is steady, warnings never blink. |
| Stale signal (500 ms with no frame) | value drops to Dim and renders `- -`, unit kept                                                                                     |
| Page change                         | instant cut — no slide, no fade                                                                                                     |

`- -` means **the sensor went quiet**. It is not the "no device" state, not a placeholder, and must never
appear in a preview or a demo.

## 10. The critical alert

Preempts every page. Full `CS_DANGER` ground, pulsing per §9; signal name in Archivo 800 tracked wide;
value in huge mono; `STOP THE ENGINE` pinned at the bottom. No status row, no page nav. Holds until
acknowledged on the dash or from the phone.

## 11. Overflow

The dash never auto-scales, wraps, ellipsises or clips a widget to make it fit. A layout that does not
fit 320 × 240 is **rejected at config load**, and the Tuner flags it before writing. Assert this on
`PUT_CONFIG` and fail loudly.

## 12. Checklist before you open a PR

- [ ] No fill, box, border or background behind any value widget.
- [ ] Left padding on every widget is 0; nothing is centred.
- [ ] Rules: 2 px ink on primaries, 1 px track on secondaries, 2 px danger on danger widgets.
- [ ] Kickers uppercase Archivo 800 at 10 px in Dim; values mono with tabular numerals.
- [ ] Units lowercase, in Dim, inline after the value; none on gear, lap, knock or a button.
- [ ] Spans match `DASH_PAGES.json` on all six pages.
- [ ] Status row has exactly three fields, bus rate on the left.
- [ ] Shift light: 7 ink + 2 danger + 3 track, 12 cells.
- [ ] Warning readings amber `#FF8800`; danger `#FF4444`; engaged buttons filled `#FF4747`; never swapped.
- [ ] Every unavailable control states its reason in the kicker, and armed appears only on the controls
      that declare it (§6).
- [ ] Only armed pulses. No active control, no warning and no cut band moves.
- [ ] Cut band: right severity colour, name from the profile, 1.5 s minimum, stacks to three.
- [ ] No animation outside §9; page change is a cut.
- [ ] Radius 0, no shadow, no gradient, no tenth token.

## 13. Order of work

1. Regenerate the two LVGL fonts at the §3 device sizes.
2. Theme tokens (§2), both themes.
3. The widget grammar (§5) — this is where the drift is; strip any card/box/fill first.
4. Grid and spans per page from `DASH_PAGES.json` (§4).
5. Shift light and status row (§7, §8).
6. Buttons (§6) — all four states, including the unavailable pair.
7. Motion (§9), then the alert (§10) and the overflow assert (§11).

Follow the firmware's own ownership rules (`2.3 LVGL ownership`, `2.4 Page lifecycle`): widgets are
rebuilt on page change, never mutated across pages; no `lv_obj_clean` outside page teardown. If a memory
or font-budget constraint forces a deviation, keep the grammar and document what changed and why.
